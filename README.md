The IP Resolver Commenter is a Burp Suite extension written in Python designed to enhance your Intruder analysis by appending resolved IP addresses to the comments field of each request. This integration allows users to quickly reference the IP addresses associated with each hostname directly within the Intruder tab, facilitating a more informed and efficient analysis process without leaving the Burp Suite environment.

Features
IP Resolution: Dynamically resolves the IP address for each hostname encountered in Intruder requests.
Comment Integration: Appends the resolved IP address to the comments field of each Intruder request, making the IP address readily visible in the corresponding column within the Intruder results.
Ease of Use: Operates seamlessly within the Intruder context, requiring no additional user interaction to view IP addresses.
Requirements
Burp Suite (Community or Professional)
Jython configured within Burp Suite to run Python scripts
Installation
Ensure Jython is properly installed and configured within your Burp Suite environment.
Download the IP Resolver Commenter script from the GitHub repository.
In Burp Suite, navigate to the Extender tab and then to the Extensions sub-tab.
Click Add, select Python as the extension type, and choose the downloaded script.
Usage
Once installed, the extension automatically processes all HTTP requests generated by the Intruder. It resolves the IP address for each request's hostname and appends this information to the request's comment field. These comments are then visible within the Intruder's results table, providing immediate access to the IP addresses without any additional steps.
